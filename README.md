I created this beginner-friendly HTML and CSS project to showcase fundamental web development skills, including responsive layout design, styling with gradients and borders, and adding interactivity through JavaScript.

The webpage introduces visitors to basketball with engaging visuals, a clean layout, and a fun user interaction—when users click a button, they’re prompted to enter their name and email to "sign up" for basketball lessons. This project highlights my growing skills in:

HTML structure and semantic elements
CSS styling and layout (including flexbox, gradients, and hover effects)
JavaScript basics (event listeners and prompts)
Building and styling responsive containers
